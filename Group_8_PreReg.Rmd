# Study Information

## Title

```{=html}
<!-- Provide the working title of your study. It may be the same title that you submit for publication of your final manuscript, but it is not a requirement. The title should be a specific and informative description of a project. Vague titles such as 'Fruit fly preregistration plan' are not appropriate.

Example: Effect of sugar on brownie tastiness. -->
```
`r rmarkdown::metadata$title` The effects of wolves on moose presence and abundance in central Sweden.

## Description

```{=html}
<!-- Please give a brief description of your study, including some background, the purpose of the of the study, or broad research questions. The description should be no longer than the length of an abstract. It can give some context for the proposed study, but great detail is not needed here for your preregistration.

Example: Though there is strong evidence to suggest that sugar affects taste preferences, the effect has never been demonstrated in brownies. Therefore, we will measure taste preference for four different levels of sugar concentration in a standard brownie recipe to determine if the effect exists in this pastry. -->
```
Predator-prey interactions often have strong effects on the lower trophic levels in a given environment. For example, upon the re-establishment of wolves in a national park in North America, aspen trees saw markedly increased recruitment [@ripple2014]. Apex predator reintroduction is often considered to benefit ecosystems by limiting the consumption of lower trophic levels by grazers, and by providing meals for scavengers [@ripple2004].

However, most research on the effects of predator reintroduction has been conducted in natural areas minimally affected by human activities [@kuijper2016]. Due to climate-driven relocation and controlled reintroduction programs, modern and future predator populations may become established in areas of strong anthropogenic influence. Thus, when predicting future effects of predators, it is important to conduct research in areas with nearby human activity, to discern how it may affect predator-prey interactions [@kuijper2016].

Recent studies in Europe have found that wolf reintroduction does not impart biodiversity benefits to lower trophic levels, contrasting observations made in American National Parks. For example, @gicquel2020 reported that wolf reintroduction slightly increased moose browsing damage to Scots Pine trees in Sweden, as did @ausilio2021. 

By surveying moose pellets, @auilio2021 also found that wolf presence and wolf territory establishment had slightly positive effects on moose presence and abundance. Other factors, including distance from roads (an indirect measure of human activities), had much stronger effects on moose populations than wolves [@ausilio2021]. 

Future populations of predators will continue to establish themselves in areas of anthropogenic influence. It is important to critically investigate the effects that they may, or may not, have on prey populations and lower trophic levels in these areas. To increase certainty in their paradigm-questioning results, we will replicate @ausilio2021's research, conducting parallel analyses on areas that are just north of the original study area.

## Hypotheses

```{=html}
<!-- List specific, concise, and testable hypotheses. Please state if the hypotheses are directional or non-directional. If directional, state the direction. A predicted effect is also appropriate here. If a specific interaction or moderation is important to your research, you can list that as a separate hypothesis.

Example: If taste affects preference, then mean preference indices will be higher with higher concentrations of sugar. -->
```
We hypothesize that:

1) Wolf presence and wolf territory establishment will moderately increase the probability of moose presence, and overall moose abundance. 

2) 'Distance from roads' will effect moose presence and abundance more strongly than wolf presence or wolf territory establishment. 

# Design Plan

<!-- In this section, you will be asked to describe the overall design of your study. Remember that this research plan is designed to register a single study, so if you have multiple experimental designs, please complete a separate preregistration. -->

## Study type

The study type is a replication of the original paper by Ausilio et al. entitled *Ecological Effects of Wolves on Anthropogenic Landscapes: The Potential for Trophic Cascades is Context-Dependent*.

## Study design

```{=html}
<!-- Describe your study design. Examples include two-group, factorial, randomized block, and repeated measures. Is it a between (unpaired), within-subject (paired), or mixed design? Describe any counterbalancing required. Typical study designs for observation studies include cohort, cross sectional, and case-control studies.

This question has a variety of possible answers. The key is for a researcher to be as detailed as is necessary given the specifics of their design. Be careful to determine if every parameter has been specified in the description of the study design. There may be some overlap between this question and the following questions. That is OK, as long as sufficient detail is given in one of the areas to provide all of the requested information. For example, if the study design describes a complete factorial, 2 X 3 design and the treatments and levels are specified previously, you do not have to repeat that information.

Example: We have a between subjects design with 1 factor (sugar by mass) with 4 levels. -->

*Our proposed study maybe could be classified as two-group, between-subjects study with repeated measures? I.e. plots where wolves are established and plots where wolves are not established are observed (via moose pellet counts) over time?* Unsure on this..

# Sampling Plan

<!-- In this section we’ll ask you to describe how you plan to collect samples, as well as the number of samples you plan to collect and your rationale for this decision. Please keep in mind that the data described in this section should be the actual data used for analysis, so if you are using a subset of a larger dataset, please describe the subset that will actually be used in your study. -->

## Existing data

<!-- Preregistration is designed to make clear the distinction between confirmatory tests, specified prior to seeing the data, and exploratory analyses conducted after observing the data. Therefore, creating a research plan in which existing data will be used presents unique challenges. Please select the description that best describes your situation. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have questions about how to answer this question (prereg@cos.io). -->

**Registration prior to accessing the data**. As of the date of submission, the data exist, but have not been accessed by you or your collaborators. Commonly, this includes data that has been collected by another researcher or institution.

## Explanation of existing data

```{=html}
<!-- If you indicate that you will be using some data that already exist in this study, please describe the steps you have taken to assure that you are unaware of any patterns or summary statistics in the data. This may include an explanation of how access to the data has been limited, who has observed the data, or how you have avoided observing any analysis of the specific data you will use in your study.

An appropriate instance of using existing data would be collecting a sample size much larger than is required for the study, using a small portion of it to conduct exploratory analysis, and then registering one particular analysis that showed promising results. After registration, conduct the specified analysis on that part of the dataset that had not been investigated by the researcher up to that point.

## Data collection procedures

```{=html}
<!-- Please describe the process by which you will collect your data. If you are using human subjects, this should include the population from which you obtain subjects, recruitment efforts, payment for participation, how subjects will be selected for eligibility from the initial pool (e.g. inclusion and exclusion rules), and your study timeline. For studies that donÍt include human subjects, include information about how you will collect samples, duration of data gathering efforts, source or location of samples, or batch numbers you will use.

The answer to this question requires a specific set of instructions so that another person could repeat the data collection procedures and recreate the study population. Alternatively, if the study population would be unable to be reproduced because it relies on a specific set of circumstances unlikely to be recreated (e.g., a community of people from a specific time and location), the criteria and methods for creating the group and the rationale for this unique set of subjects should be clear.

Example: Participants will be recruited through advertisements at local pastry shops. Participants will be paid $10 for agreeing to participate (raised to $30 if our sample size is not reached within 15 days of beginning recruitment). Participants must be at least 18 years old and be able to eat the ingredients of the pastries. -->

## Sample size

```{=html}
<!-- Describe the sample size of your study. How many units will be analyzed in the study? This could be the number of people, birds, classrooms, plots, interactions, or countries included. If the units are not individuals, then describe the size requirements for each unit. If you are using a clustered or multilevel design, how many units are you collecting at each level of the analysis? For some studies, this will simply be the number of samples or the number of clusters. For others, this could be an expected range, minimum, or maximum number.

Example: Our target sample size is 280 participants. We will attempt to recruit up to 320, assuming that not all will complete the total task. -->
```
The study will be conducted within the region of south-central Sweden where wolves have established territories. The sample size will be determined by the data available for this region ( number of surveyed plots?).

## Sample size rationale

```{=html}
<!-- This could include a power analysis or an arbitrary constraint such as time, money, or personnel. This gives you an opportunity to specifically state how the sample size will be determined. A wide range of possible answers is acceptable; remember that transparency is more important than principled justifications. If you state any reason for a sample size upfront, it is better than stating no reason and leaving the reader to "fill in the blanks." Acceptable rationales include: a power analysis, an arbitrary number of subjects, or a number based on time or monetary constraints.

Example: We used the software program G*Power to conduct a power analysis. Our goal was to obtain .95 power to detect a medium effect size of .25 at the standard .05 alpha error probability. -->
```
Sampling size will be determined by the data available for the various variables used within our study region.

# Variables

<!-- In this section you can describe all variables (both manipulated and measured variables) that will later be used in your confirmatory analysis plan. In your analysis plan, you will have the opportunity to describe how each variable will be used. If you have variables which you are measuring for exploratory analyses, you are not required to list them, though you are permitted to do so. -->

## Measured variables

```{=html}
<!-- Describe each variable that you will measure. This will include outcome measures, as well as any predictors or covariates that you will measure. You do not need to include any variables that you plan on collecting if they are not going to be included in the confirmatory analyses of this study.

Observational studies and meta-analyses will include only measured variables. As with the previous questions, the answers here must be precise. For example, 'intelligence,' 'accuracy,' 'aggression,' and 'color' are too vague. Acceptable alternatives could be 'IQ as measured by Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale' 'percent correct,' 'number of threat displays,' and 'percent reflectance at 400 nm.'

Example: The single outcome variable will be the perceived tastiness of the single brownie each participant will eat. We will measure this by asking participants ‘How much did you enjoy eating the brownie’ (on a scale of 1-7, 1 being 'not at all', 7 being 'a great deal') and 'How good did the brownie taste' (on a scale of 1-7, 1 being 'very bad', 7 being 'very good'). -->
```
Moose pellet counts will be used to gather presence and absence data on moose. The Swedish National Forestry Inventory conducts yearly surveys between the months of May and September throughout south-central Sweden [@fridman2014]. There are four forest habitats in which surveys are conducted: clear-cut, young, thinned, and mature. During the study period, a total of \_\_\_\_ sample plots will be surveyed.

Two variables will be used to determine the effect of wolves on moose presence: 1) wolf presence, and 2) time since wolf territory establishment. The data for these two variables will be retrieved from yearly surveys performed by the national wolf-monitoring system [@liberg2011].

Distance to the nearest forest road (km) and distance to the nearest main road (km)

Forest stage (4)

## Indices

```{=html}
<!-- If any measurements are  going to be combined into an index (or even a mean), what measures will you use and how will they be combined? Include either a formula or a precise description of your method. If your are using a more complicated statistical method to combine measures (e.g. a factor analysis), you can note that here but describe the exact method in the analysis plan section.

If you are using multiple pieces of data to construct a single variable, how will this occur? Both the data that are included and the formula or weights for each measure must be specified. Standard summary statistics, such as "means" do not require a formula, though more complicated indices require either the exact formula or, if it is an established index in the field, the index must be unambiguously defined. For example, "biodiversity index" is too broad, whereas "Shannon’s biodiversity index" is appropriate.

Example: We will take the mean of the two questions above to create a single measure of 'brownie enjoyment.'  -->
```
Moose pellet counts, as previously described, will be used to calculate a relative index for moose abundance. \**how is the index calculated?*

Pine proportion

An index of food availability will be generated by summing the cover (m²) of tree species that are highly selected by moose. These species include: aspen, rowan, willow, and oak (RAWO). From this index, a categorical variable will be created denoting either presence of absence of RAWO species.

# Analysis Plan

```{=html}
<!-- You may describe one or more confirmatory analysis in this preregistration. Please remember that all analyses specified below must be reported in the final article, and any additional analyses must be noted as exploratory or hypothesis generating.

A confirmatory analysis plan must state up front which variables are predictors (independent) and which are the outcomes (dependent), otherwise it is an exploratory analysis. You are allowed to describe any exploratory work here, but a clear confirmatory analysis is required. -->
```
## Statistical models

```{=html}
<!-- What statistical model will you use to test each hypothesis? Please include the type of model (e.g. ANOVA, multiple regression, SEM, etc) and the specification of the model (this includes each variable that will be included as predictors, outcomes, or covariates). Please specify any interactions, subgroup analyses, pairwise or complex contrasts, or follow-up tests from omnibus tests. If you plan on using any positive controls, negative controls, or manipulation checks you may mention that here. Remember that any test not included here must be noted as an exploratory test in your final article.

This is perhaps the most important and most complicated question within the preregistration. As with all of the other questions, the key is to provide a specific recipe for analyzing the collected data. Ask yourself: is enough detail provided to run the same analysis again with the information provided by the user? Be aware for instances where the statistical models appear specific, but actually leave openings for the precise test. See the following examples:

- If someone specifies a 2x3 ANOVA with both factors within subjects, there is still flexibility with the various types of ANOVAs that could be run. Either a repeated measures ANOVA (RMANOVA) or a multivariate ANOVA (MANOVA) could be used for that design, which are two different tests. 
- If you are going to perform a sequential analysis and check after 50, 100, and 150 samples, you must also specify the p-values you’ll test against at those three points.

Example:  We will use a one-way between subjects ANOVA to analyze our results. The manipulated, categorical independent variable is 'sugar' whereas the dependent variable is our taste index. -->

## Transformations

```{=html}
<!-- If you plan on transforming, centering, recoding the data, or will require a coding scheme for categorical variables, please describe that process. If any categorical predictors are included in a regression, indicate how those variables will be coded (e.g. dummy coding, summation coding, etc.) and what the reference category will be.

Example: The "Effect of sugar on brownie tastiness" does not require any additional transformations. However, if it were using a regression analysis and each level of sweet had been categorically described (e.g. not sweet, somewhat sweet, sweet, and very sweet), 'sweet' could be dummy coded with 'not sweet' as the reference category. -->
```

## Inference criteria

```{=html}
<!-- What criteria will you use to make inferences? Please describe the information youÍll use (e.g. p-values, bayes factors, specific model fit indices), as well as cut-off criterion, where appropriate. Will you be using one or two tailed tests for each of your analyses? If you are comparing multiple conditions or testing multiple hypotheses, will you account for this?

p-values, confidence intervals, and effect sizes are standard means for making an inference, and any level is acceptable, though some criteria must be specified in this or previous fields. Bayesian analyses should specify a Bayes factor or a credible interval. If you are selecting models, then how will you determine the relative quality of each? In regards to multiple comparisons, this is a question with few "wrong" answers. In other words, transparency is more important than any specific method of controlling the false discovery rate or false error rate. One may state an intention to report all tests conducted or one may conduct a specific correction procedure; either strategy is acceptable.

Example: We will use the standard p<.05 criteria for determining if the ANOVA and the post hoc test suggest that the results are significantly different from those expected if the null hypothesis were correct. The post-hoc Tukey-Kramer test adjusts for multiple comparisons. -->
```
## Data exclusion

```{=html}
<!-- How will you determine what data or samples, if any, to exclude from your analyses? How will outliers be handled? Will you use any awareness check? Any rule for excluding a particular set of data is acceptable. One may describe rules for excluding a participant or for identifying outlier data.

Example: No checks will be performed to determine eligibility for inclusion besides verification that each subject answered each of the three tastiness indices. Outliers will be included in the analysis. -->
```
Enter your response here.

## Missing data

```{=html}
<!-- How will you deal with incomplete or missing data? Any relevant explanation is acceptable. As a final reminder, remember that the final analysis must follow the specified plan, and deviations must be either strongly justified or included as a separate, exploratory analysis.

Example: If a subject does not complete any of the three indices of tastiness, that subject will not be included in the analysis. -->
```
Enter your response here.

## Exploratory analyses (optional)

```{=html}
<!-- If you plan to explore your data set to look for unexpected differences or relationships, you may describe those tests here. An exploratory test is any test where a prediction is not made up front, or there are multiple possible tests that you are going to use. A statistically significant finding in an exploratory test is a great way to form a new confirmatory hypothesis, which could be registered at a later time.

Example: We expect that certain demographic traits may be related to taste preferences. Therefore, we will look for relationships between demographic variables (age, gender, income, and marital status) and the primary outcome measures of taste preferences. -->
